# Online Judge System

Our Online Judge System is a platform designed to evaluate and judge code submissions from users. It allows users to submit their solutions to a variety of programming problems, which are then automatically tested against predefined test cases. The system provides instant feedback on the correctness and efficiency of the submitted code.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Online Judge System is to offer a seamless and efficient way for programmers to practice coding, improve their problem-solving skills, and prepare for competitive programming contests or technical interviews. It serves as an educational tool for both novice and experienced developers, providing a wide range of problems to solve, from basic to advanced levels.

## Features

- **Instant Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback on their code submissions, helping them understand mistakes and improve their solutions quickly.
- **Diverse Problem Set**: The platform offers a rich collection of problems across various domains and difficulty levels, catering to different skill sets and learning objectives.
- **Automated Testing**: Submissions are automatically tested against a comprehensive set of test cases, ensuring the correctness and robustness of the solutions.
- **Competitive Programming Preparation**: It serves as an excellent preparation tool for competitive programming contests, allowing users to simulate contest environments and hone their skills.
- **One vs. One Competitions**: Users can compete against each other in real-time coding battles. Admins can create these competitions, and users can participate to test their skills in a competitive environment.

## One vs. One Competitions

The Online Judge System includes an exciting feature for one-on-one competitions, adding a competitive edge to coding practice. Admins can create these competitions, defining the problem set and rules. Users can then participate in these head-to-head battles to test their coding skills against other programmers in real-time.

- **Admin-Managed Competitions**: Admins have the ability to create and manage competitions, Admins can choose problems for the competitions and also the score for the respective problem.
- **Scoring Rules**: Once a problem is solved by one user, the other user can no longer score points for that problem. Only the first person to solve the problem gets the points assigned to it.
- **Real-Time Coding Battles**: Users compete against each other by solving the same set of problems within a specified time limit.
- **Real Time Scoring**: One vs One Competitions feature real time scoring in the competition, allowing user to keep track of their score.
- **Enhanced Engagement**: 

By leveraging the Online Judge System and its one-on-one competition feature, users can systematically improve their coding abilities, benchmark their skills against a global community, and stay motivated through continuous learning and challenge.
